// Class: SatelliteApskScalarTransmitter
//
// This class creates a SatelliteApskScalarTransmission which stores the longitude, latitude and altitude of a given transmitter.
// These values are used within the path loss and propagation calculations so that the visual x, y and z values can be
// decoupled from their actual positions. This model uses the APSK scalar model and is not used by the simulation model.
// It was implemented to provide the flexibility of using a more detailed model if required.
